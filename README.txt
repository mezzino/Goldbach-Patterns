Goldbach_Patterns

 A C++ program which can be used to compute
 data supporting the conjecture in this paper.
 Each option generates a user-specified output file
 or options to send the output to the concole.

 Input Options and output formats

   Start = srarting value of e
   End   = ending value of e

   Output f = output file on desktop
     or   c for console output

   Code:  'f' first induction solution step
	  'l' last induction solution step
	  'x' sequential solution exceptions only
	  '5' include 5 in sequential solution
	  't' total number of induction solutions
	  'a' all  solutions
 
 Output file option
	Formatted solutions depending on code 
	f, l, 5, x, t, a
